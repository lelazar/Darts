Home Darts Log with two players


Just a small command line app which logs the players' hits and the game lasts until any of the players hit 0
points down from 301 or 501.

This is my first C++ hobby projects for two of my friends who really like playing darts with each other
at home and right now they are using an Excel file to record the results.

I would like to do some inputs in it like how many players, what are the name(s) of the player(s) and whether
they would like to play a 301 or a 501 game.

Also would like to print out a summary screen with average shots and best shot/game.

Ps: using int32 and FText are the standards of Unreal Engine. In the near future I would like to learn and work with
Unreal Engine 4 to make video games.
